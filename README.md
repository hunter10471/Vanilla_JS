# Vanilla_JS Projects

This repository consists of 10 extensive HTML, CSS and Javascript projects to further enhance Jacascript skills as well as practice basic methods of these technologies.

## 1. Weather App

This is a weather information application based on the weatherAPI by www.weatherapi.com. The API provides abundant resources for weather forecasting and has simple
api routes, best of all it provides weather icons too! 

The app is completely media-responsive and is made using flex-box which compliments its responsiveness.

### Usage
Just search your city in the search box on the top-right corner and it'll show details such as :
- Temprature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Visibility
- Clouds

It will also show the last three searches you made under the search box.

P.S Took the beautiful background from www.unsplash.com

## 2. The Film Guide

This is a movie, show, cartoons information guide that shows all the details regarding any query you have. The app uses API from 
https://www.themoviedb.org which provides all details such as cast, ratings, release dates etc efficiently.

The best part about this app is that it has a dark mode for all us dark lovers too ! This application is media-responsive as well 
and uses flex-box to accomodate that.

### Usage
Enter any query you might have in the search box on the navbar to fetch your results, by default the application loads all the popular movies when opened. Click on the poster of any show or movie you'd want details of and a modal will pop-up showing :
- release dates 
- ratings
- overview or plot
