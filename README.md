## 1. Weather App

This is a weather information application based on the weatherAPI by www.weatherapi.com. The API provides abundant resources for weather forecasting and has simple
api routes, best of all it provides weather icons too! 

The app is completely media responsive and is made using flex-box which compliments its responsiveness.

### Usage
Just search your city in the search box on the top-right corner and it'll show details such as :
- Temprature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Visibility
- Clouds

It will also show the last three searches you made under the search box.
